QRCode Service Project

Description
This is the QRCode Service project I built myself, leveraging Spring Boot to generate QR codes on the fly. QR codes are versatile 2D barcodes that can store large amounts of data and can be scanned by most smartphones. Through this project, you can learn about QR code technology, generate them programmatically, and integrate them into a web service.

Key Features
	•	Generates QR codes using the ZXing library.
	•	Allows custom parameters such as size, image format, and error correction levels.
	•	Returns the generated QR code image via a REST endpoint.
